### TO-DO APP
## TO-DO
API response contains a list/array of tasks.
A single task can have a title, a description and 1 of the 3 states (todo, in-progress, done)
There should be 3 views/tabs (todo, in-progress, done)
Store the api response using a global state manager (e.g Context API)
Tasks should be able to be moved 1 step forward or backward either via drag or by clicking on a specific button (e.g Move to todo, Move to In progress, Move to Done)
Task status changes should reflect both on the backend and fronted (only after successful response from the backend).
